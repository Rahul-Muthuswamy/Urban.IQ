## ⚖️ **Enforcement Guidelines**

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #0078D4; padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining consequences for violations:

<br/>

### **1. Correction**

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

<br/>

### **2. Warning**

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

<br/>

### **3. Temporary Ban**

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior or spreading misinformation.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time (typically 7-30 days). No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

<br/>

### **4. Permanent Ban**

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals, or severe threats to civic integrity (voter suppression, spreading election misinformation).

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community. This includes loss of access to the Urban.IQ platform, GitHub repositories, and all associated community spaces.

<br/>

### **Information Integrity**

➤ **Share verified information** from credible sources

➤ **Correct mistakes** promptly when discovered

➤ **Report misinformation** through proper channels

➤ **Avoid spreading unverified claims** about elections, candidates, or civic processes

<br/>

### **Inclusive Participation**

➤ **Welcome newcomers** to civic discussions
