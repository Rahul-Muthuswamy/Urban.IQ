<br/>

## ❓ **Why UrbanIQ?**

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #0078D4; padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">

### The Problem

➤ **Information Accessibility Gap** – Citizens lack access to clear, reliable civic information, leading to widespread confusion and disengagement.

<br/>

➤ **Fragmented Civic Resources** – Traditional channels scatter information across multiple platforms, making it difficult to find what's needed.

<br/>

➤ **Complex Government Data** – Government data is often complex, technical, and difficult for average citizens to understand.

<br/>

➤ **Limited Inclusivity** – Existing platforms fail to support diverse users across different languages, literacy levels, and abilities.

<br/>

➤ **Low Civic Participation** – People are disengaged not because they don't care, but because current systems aren't built for them.

<br/>

➤ **Misinformation During Elections** – Rapid spread of misinformation during critical civic events undermines trust and informed decision-making.

</div>

<br/>

### **Safety and Trust**

Comprehensive moderation tools with dedicated dashboards, review workflows, and reporting systems ensure healthy, respectful conversations. Content filtering and role-based access controls maintain platform integrity.

<br/>

### **Real-Time Personalization**

Dynamic, personalized feeds update posts, discussions, and civic alerts based on what matters most to each user, considering their location, district, and civic interests.

<br/>

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #0078D4; padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">

### **RAG-Powered Intelligence**

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/urbaniq_rag_architecture_diagram.png" alt="RAG Architecture" width="750"/>
</p>

<br/>

**1. Data Ingestion** – Election information, candidate profiles, policies, and FAQs are processed and stored in Azure Cosmos DB with vector embeddings.

<br/>

**2. Query Processing** – When users ask questions, the query is converted to embeddings using Azure OpenAI's text-embedding-small model.

<br/>

**3. Semantic Retrieval** – The system performs semantic search across the vector database to retrieve the most relevant civic information.

<br/>

**4. Context Generation** – Retrieved documents are combined with the user query to create enriched context.

<br/>

**5. Response Generation** – Azure OpenAI GPT-4o-mini generates accurate, contextual responses based on verified civic data.

<br/>

**6. Content Filtering** – Responses undergo content filtering to ensure safety, removing political bias and inappropriate content.

<br/>

**7. Response Delivery** – Clean, verified information is delivered to users in natural language.

<br/>

### **Natural Language Processing**

The platform processes civic queries through multiple stages:

➤ **Intent Recognition** – User queries are analyzed to understand civic information needs  

➤ **Entity Extraction** – Key entities like district names, candidate names, and dates are extracted  

➤ **Context Preservation** – Multi-turn conversations maintain context for follow-up questions  

➤ **Response Formatting** – Information is formatted in clear, accessible language

<br/>

### **Voice Assistance**

Azure Speech Services enable voice-based civic engagement:

➤ **Speech-to-Text** – User voice input is transcribed with support for multiple languages (English, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian)  

➤ **Query Processing** – Transcribed text is processed through the RAG pipeline  

➤ **Text-to-Speech** – Responses are converted to natural speech output  

➤ **Language Support** – Automatic language detection and multi-language synthesis

<br/>

### **Geospatial Navigation**

Azure Maps provides comprehensive location services:

➤ **Geocoding** – Physical addresses are converted to precise coordinates  

➤ **Route Calculation** – The system calculates optimal routes to civic destinations  

➤ **Traffic Integration** – Real-time traffic data ensures accurate ETAs  

➤ **Interactive Visualization** – MapLibre-powered interface displays locations and routes  

➤ **Location Search** – Users can search for specific civic locations

<br/>

### **Community Moderation Pipeline**

Maintaining platform integrity involves multiple layers:

➤ **Automated Filtering** – Content undergoes initial filtering for inappropriate language  

➤ **User Reporting** – Community members can report posts, comments, and events  

➤ **Moderator Review** – Reported content appears in moderator dashboards  

➤ **Approval Workflows** – New events require moderator approval before publication  

➤ **Action Tracking** – All moderation actions are logged with timestamps  

➤ **Analytics** – Moderation statistics provide insights into community health
