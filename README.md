<br/>

## ❓ **Why UrbanIQ?**

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #0078D4; padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">

### The Problem

➤ **Information Accessibility Gap** – Citizens lack access to clear, reliable civic information, leading to widespread confusion and disengagement.

➤ **Fragmented Civic Resources** – Traditional channels scatter information across multiple platforms, making it difficult to find what's needed.

➤ **Complex Government Data** – Government data is often complex, technical, and difficult for average citizens to understand.

➤ **Limited Inclusivity** – Existing platforms fail to support diverse users across different languages, literacy levels, and abilities.

➤ **Low Civic Participation** – People are disengaged not because they don't care, but because current systems aren't built for them.

➤ **Misinformation During Elections** – Rapid spread of misinformation during critical civic events undermines trust and informed decision-making.

</div>

<br/>

## 🎨 **Design Philosophy**

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #0078D4; padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">

### **User-Centric Accessibility**

UrbanIQ prioritizes inclusive design with ARIA support, screen reader compatibility, multilingual voice guidance, and accessible layouts. Every feature ensures civic knowledge remains accessible regardless of language, literacy level, or physical ability.

### **Intelligent Information Delivery**

The platform leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Azure AI services to provide unbiased, verified answers. Information is delivered in clear, simple terms tailored to each user's needs.

### **Community-Powered Engagement**

UrbanIQ recognizes that civic engagement extends beyond information consumption. The platform enables citizens to create communities, organize events, and participate in meaningful discussions that drive real-world action.

### **Safety and Trust**

Comprehensive moderation tools with dedicated dashboards, review workflows, and reporting systems ensure healthy, respectful conversations. Content filtering and role-based access controls maintain platform integrity.

### **Real-Time Personalization**

Dynamic, personalized feeds update posts, discussions, and civic alerts based on what matters most to each user, considering their location, district, and civic interests.

### **Privacy and Security**

Built with security-first principles, UrbanIQ implements encrypted storage, secure APIs, and strict role-based access controls to protect sensitive civic information.

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #0078D4; padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">

### **RAG-Powered Intelligence**

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/urbaniq_rag_architecture_diagram.png" alt="RAG Architecture" width="750"/>
</p>

<br/>

**1. Data Ingestion** – Election information, candidate profiles, policies, and FAQs are processed and stored in Azure Cosmos DB with vector embeddings.

**2. Query Processing** – When users ask questions, the query is converted to embeddings using Azure OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model.

**3. Semantic Retrieval** – The system performs semantic search across the vector database to retrieve the most relevant civic information.

**4. Context Generation** – Retrieved documents are combined with the user query to create enriched context.

**5. Response Generation** – Azure OpenAI GPT-4o-mini generates accurate, contextual responses based on verified civic data.

**6. Content Filtering** – Responses undergo content filtering to ensure safety, removing political bias and inappropriate content.

**7. Response Delivery** – Clean, verified information is delivered to users in natural language.

<br/>

### **Natural Language Processing**

The platform processes civic queries through multiple stages:

➤ **Intent Recognition** – User queries are analyzed to understand civic information needs  
➤ **Entity Extraction** – Key entities like district names, candidate names, and dates are extracted  
➤ **Context Preservation** – Multi-turn conversations maintain context for follow-up questions  
➤ **Response Formatting** – Information is formatted in clear, accessible language

<br/>

### **Voice Assistance**

Azure Speech Services enable voice-based civic engagement:

➤ **Speech-to-Text** – User voice input is transcribed with support for multiple languages (English, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian)  
➤ **Query Processing** – Transcribed text is processed through the RAG pipeline  
➤ **Text-to-Speech** – Responses are converted to natural speech output  
➤ **Language Support** – Automatic language detection and multi-language synthesis

<br/>

### **Geospatial Navigation**

Azure Maps provides comprehensive location services:

➤ **Geocoding** – Physical addresses are converted to precise coordinates  
➤ **Route Calculation** – The system calculates optimal routes to civic destinations  
➤ **Traffic Integration** – Real-time traffic data ensures accurate ETAs  
➤ **Interactive Visualization** – MapLibre-powered interface displays locations and routes  
➤ **Location Search** – Users can search for specific civic locations

<br/>

### **Community Moderation Pipeline**

Maintaining platform integrity involves multiple layers:

➤ **Automated Filtering** – Content undergoes initial filtering for inappropriate language  
➤ **User Reporting** – Community members can report posts, comments, and events  
➤ **Moderator Review** – Reported content appears in moderator dashboards  
➤ **Approval Workflows** – New events require moderator approval before publication  
➤ **Action Tracking** – All moderation actions are logged with timestamps  
➤ **Analytics** – Moderation statistics provide insights into community health
