## Overview

UrbanIQ addresses the critical gap in civic engagement by providing a unified platform where citizens can access clear, reliable civic information, participate in community discussions, and take meaningful action. The platform combines Azure AI services with modern web technologies to deliver an accessible, trustworthy, and engaging civic experience.

## Why?

- **Information Accessibility Gap**: Citizens lack access to clear, reliable civic information, leading to confusion and disengagement across communities.

- **Fragmented Civic Resources**: Traditional channels scatter information across multiple platforms, making it difficult for citizens to find what they need.

- **Complex Government Data**: Government data is often complex, technical, and difficult for average citizens to understand and leverage.

- **Limited Inclusivity**: Existing platforms fail to support diverse users across different languages, literacy levels, backgrounds, and abilities.

- **Low Civic Participation**: People are disengaged not because they don't care, but because current systems aren't built for them.

- **Misinformation During Elections**: Rapid spread of misinformation during critical civic events undermines trust and informed decision-making.

# Design

## User-Centric Accessibility

UrbanIQ prioritizes inclusive design with ARIA support, screen reader compatibility, multilingual voice guidance, and accessible layouts. Every feature is built to ensure civic knowledge remains accessible regardless of language, literacy level, or physical ability.

## Intelligent Information Delivery

The platform leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Azure AI services to provide unbiased, verified answers that citizens can trust. Information is delivered in clear, simple terms tailored to each user's needs.

## Community-Powered Engagement

UrbanIQ recognizes that civic engagement extends beyond information consumption. The platform enables citizens to create communities, organize events, and participate in meaningful discussions that drive real-world action.

## Safety and Trust

Comprehensive moderation tools with dedicated dashboards, review workflows, and reporting systems ensure healthy, respectful conversations. Content filtering and role-based access controls maintain platform integrity.

## Real-Time Personalization

Dynamic, personalized feeds update posts, discussions, and civic alerts based on what matters most to each user, considering their location, district, and civic interests.

## Privacy and Security

Built with security-first principles, UrbanIQ implements encrypted storage, secure APIs, and strict role-based access controls to protect sensitive civic information.

# Working

## RAG-Powered Intelligence

![RAG Architecture](./assets/urbaniq_rag_architecture_diagram.png)

1. **Data Ingestion**: Election information, candidate profiles, policies, and FAQs are processed and stored in Azure Cosmos DB with vector embeddings.

2. **Query Processing**: When users ask questions, the query is converted to embeddings using Azure OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model.

3. **Semantic Retrieval**: The system performs semantic search across the vector database to retrieve the most relevant civic information.

4. **Context Generation**: Retrieved documents are combined with the user query to create enriched context.

5. **Response Generation**: Azure OpenAI GPT-4o-mini generates accurate, contextual responses based on verified civic data.

6. **Content Filtering**: Responses undergo content filtering to ensure safety, removing political bias and inappropriate content.

7. **Response Delivery**: Clean, verified information is delivered to users in natural language.

## Natural Language Processing

The platform processes civic queries through multiple stages:

1. **Intent Recognition**: User queries are analyzed to understand civic information needs (polling locations, candidate information, voting procedures).

2. **Entity Extraction**: Key entities like district names, candidate names, and dates are extracted for precise information retrieval.

3. **Context Preservation**: Multi-turn conversations maintain context for follow-up questions and clarifications.

4. **Response Formatting**: Information is formatted in clear, accessible language appropriate for diverse literacy levels.

## Voice Assistance

Azure Speech Services enable voice-based civic engagement:

1. **Speech-to-Text**: User voice input is transcribed using Azure Speech Service with support for multiple languages (English, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian).

2. **Query Processing**: Transcribed text is processed through the RAG pipeline for information retrieval.

3. **Text-to-Speech**: Responses are converted to natural speech output, benefiting users with literacy challenges or visual barriers.

4. **Language Support**: Automatic language detection and multi-language synthesis for inclusive access.

## Geospatial Navigation

Azure Maps provides comprehensive location services:

1. **Geocoding**: Physical addresses are converted to precise coordinates using Azure Maps geocoding API.

2. **Route Calculation**: The system calculates optimal routes from user location to civic destinations (polling stations, event venues).

3. **Traffic Integration**: Real-time traffic data ensures accurate ETAs and route adjustments.

4. **Interactive Visualization**: MapLibre-powered interface displays locations, routes, and civic points of interest.

5. **Location Search**: Users can search for specific civic locations or discover nearby community resources.

## Community Moderation Pipeline

Maintaining platform integrity involves multiple layers:

1. **Automated Filtering**: Content undergoes initial filtering for inappropriate language and harmful content.

2. **User Reporting**: Community members can report posts, comments, and events that violate guidelines.

3. **Moderator Review**: Reported content appears in moderator dashboards for human review.

4. **Approval Workflows**: New events and posts in moderated communities require moderator approval before publication.

5. **Action Tracking**: All moderation actions are logged with timestamps, reasons, and reviewing moderator information.

6. **Analytics**: Moderation statistics provide insights into community health and content quality.
